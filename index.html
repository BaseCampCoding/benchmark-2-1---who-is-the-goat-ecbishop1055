        <h2>Some Backstory for Ken Kaneki.</h2>
        <p>
            His life starts out as a normal Japanese college student, however in tokyo at this time there are a specifc breed of people called ghouls roaming the streets.
            These ghouls are very dangerous because they eat regular citizens to gain power and stay alive. Kaneki is attacked by a ghoul one day when walking home with a girl. The girl who he was with was named 
            Rize and she turns out to be a ghoul. She is killed but he is badly injured and is given her organs as a transplant. After this he learns he is a half ghoul and from there on out called the one-eyed ghoul or eyepatch.
            This is a very brief summary just to give you an idea of who he is and why he is the main character in the show.

        <h2>What is Ken Kaneki good at?</h2>
        <p>
            Ken Kaneki is really good at decision making certain situations. He may sometimes take the morally wrong direction, but it's in order to save the people he loves.
            The main meaning behind everything Kaneki does is to give the theme of good vs evil, because he plays on the both sides of the battle and it really shows what happens.
